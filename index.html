<body>
I am an empirical economist working at the intersection of market design, industrial organization, and public finance. This year I am a post-doctoral fellow at the NYU Furman Center, and next year I begin as an assistant professor in the NYU economics department. I did my PhD at MIT and my undergrad at the University of Chicago.
